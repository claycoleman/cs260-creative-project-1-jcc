# CS 260, Creative Project #1

## Maame Homepage and Online Dashboard

I am working with a couple of public health majors at BYU to create a maternal health platform that helps community health workers monitor and care for pregnant women. I need to build an online dashboard to go along with the mobile apps, so I figured that doing so for the Creative Project assignments in CS 260 made sense.

## Requirements for Creative Project #1

- [x] A home page
- [x] Three or more additional pages
- [x] The site uses some images
- [x] The site uses Bootstrap for a menu
- [x] A footer that lists the URL for your GitHub repository
